# My Pets
Link: https://mypet-leonardomlouzas.vercel.app/

This is a site for pet owners to manage all their pets info in a single place. You can add and remove pets, manage their vaccinations date, pet-shop visits, food stock, and other features.
It was made in React using Typescript and ContextAPI.

**This project was made for the Kenzie Academy Brasil bootcamp with help of my group. Participants:**
1. Diego H Paixão Sousa
2. Guilherme L. Desoler
3. Leonardo Moreira Louzas
